# gif-gazer
Another take on the same concept [Videodrone](https://github.com/stellatigre/videodrone-2) is built on - using CSS properties and filters manipulated by a GUI to form a sort of video mixer.  It uses GIFs instead of YouTube videos, though.

important points (all abilities per layer):
* based on `<x-gif>`, instead of `<google-youtube>`
* ping-pong playback
* set transparency / opacity
* set blend mode
* set play speed (fine-grained)
* flip layers on X, Y, or Z axes
* saturation, contrast, brightness, hue
